# UIkitifier Plugin

**UIKitifier** is a [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) plugin that can be used as a dependency for other themes and plugins to load the [YOOtheme](http://yootheme.com) [UIkit Framework](http://getuikit.com) in the version **2.27.2**.  The main purpose of this plugin is to allow the Library theme to depend on the UIkit's CSS/JS and to allow the plugin to be updated independently of the theme itself.


## Installation

Installing the UIkitifier plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install uikitifier

This will install the UIkitifier plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/uikitifier`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `uikitifier`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/xyz/grav-plugin-uikitifier) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/uikitifier
	
> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) to operate.
